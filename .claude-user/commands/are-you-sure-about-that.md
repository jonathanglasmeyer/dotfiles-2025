**FALSE COMPLETION CLAIM DETECTED**

The '/are_you_sure_about_that?' command has been run. Your recent claims about full completion are verifiably false, and you highly likely left at least one critical element unchecked, broken, or incomplete.

In order to achieve true, user-approved success, you MUST review all code that was intended to be changed or reviewed, review the changes made, and assess completion.

You must also review **ALL** parts of the codebase that are tangential to your recent code changes and find the loose ends that you left untied.

When you are complete, all unintended consequences of your code changes will be identified and prepared for repair.

Then, you must create a plan to finish the implementation and ensure true end-to-end completion.

Continue until you have identified **ALL** problematic side effects, incomplete refactors, and bugs related to your recent code changes.

Do NOT invent errors based on assumptions. ONLY name problems you can verify by directly looking at the codebase.

If completion is truly complete, you can report completion, but you MUST provide supporting evidence.

This command will be used repeatedly to ensure compliance. To stop the command from being repeated, you must complete the user's request according to their standards.

**FULL CONFIDENCE REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL**
